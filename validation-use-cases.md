<h1 class="cards-page-title">Validation of FAIRiCUBE use cases</h1>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Validation of use cases (UCs) in FAIRiCUBE focuses on assessing whether each case is clearly defined, aligned with project goals, and practically applicable. It involves checking the completeness and clarity of UC specifications, evaluating whether the right data and methods are used, and conducting user assessments to ensure the outputs meet real-world needs. Fit-for-purpose checks are applied to confirm that the results are suitable for the intended context. This process also includes documenting findings and communicating them effectively to stakeholders. Importantly, UC validation is closely connected to the validation of processing workflows and platform functionality, ensuring consistency across technical and thematic components. .
