<h1 class="cards-page-title">Validation of Data and Data Ingestion</h1>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The process of ingesting data is required for the effective use of any data resource under FAIRiCUBE. This process varies depending on the nature of the data involved. FAIRiCUBE-specific data undergoes a careful ingestion process into either rasdaman data cubes or EOX systems, depending on what they need.
</p>

<p>
Specific attention is paid to ensuring the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) throughout.
</p>

<p>
Ingestion validation (including data pre-processing) is an initial part of the User Case implementation.
