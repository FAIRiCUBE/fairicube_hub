<h1 class="cards-page-title">Validation of FAIRiCUBE Hub Services</h1>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The FAIRiCUBE Hub service validation ensures that the different components of the FAIRiCUBE Hub - covering information access, data availability, processing tools, and visualisation â€” work smoothly both on their own and as a unified system. This involves testing how well the various parts integrate, whether users can access and share data and tools reliably, and how intuitive and robust the interfaces are. The validation also identifies any issues or areas for improvement and checks that all shared resources meet project standards and user expectations.
